# GitGreenDots

### Wow, you found me :O 

Why did I write this terrible console program? 

At one point in my career I had a manager (someone with a technical title but lacking technical skills) that questioned my production because my Git commit count was low. I have a habit of working on a feature and pushing when it's done. I also at the time was in an architect position where I wasn't committing code daily. 

Without taking into account the complexity of problems I was working on, they presented me with a screenshot of my Git commit chart showing only a few green (blue in my case because of GitLab) dots. At first I thought it was a joke but they were serious. They were measuring developers performance off of artificial metrics. If they saw a green dot they assumed the developer was getting a lot done and was performing better than someone with fewer green dots.

The memory of this came back recently so I decided I would write a script to generate a bunch of fake commits to make my commit chart look green and to prove that commit count is a worthless metric. 

One commit could have a single character change that had a larger impact than 200 commits across weeks. Don't use your developers commit count as a metric for their performance, if you do, send them this script first ;)
